Hi! I am Ahmad Sheikhzada, Physics Ph.D. and currently working as research scientist at Center for Accelerator Science (CAS) at Old Dominion University.
I am also active in the field of data science and machine learning and have worked on small and large projects. This website is under construction and will present some of my work hopefully very soon.
